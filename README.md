# Javascript
Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository!
This repo contains all the notes, practice files, and mini-projects I create while learning JavaScript.
I update this repository regularly as I progress through different concepts.

#Variables
There are three types of variable in js. 

1) var 
Function-scoped (NOT global-scoped unless declared outside a function).
Can be redeclared.
Can be updated.
Gets hoisted (but initialized with undefined).

2) let
Block-scoped.
Can be updated.
Cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
Hoisted but not initialized.

3) const
Block-scoped.
Cannot be redeclared.
Cannot be reassigned.
